# The Matrix
The Matrix is a small library/utility class that is distributed in a C++ header file.  It simplifies working with arrays.

It was originally written around the year 2000.  Things have moved on a lot in C++ and I haven't kept up with the changes, so you'll very likely find obsolete/outdate/plain wrong stuff in this code.

I also did some articles explaining the usages of this class.  I recently ported these over to [my blog](https://dunnhq.com):
